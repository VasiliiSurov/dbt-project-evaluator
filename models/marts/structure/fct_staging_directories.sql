-- Because we often work with multiple data sources, in our staging directory, we create one directory per source.

-- This model finds all cases where a staging model or source definition is NOT in the appropriate subdirectory
    -- how should we define "staging" model here? 
        -- by naming convention in stg_all_graph_resource?
        -- by being in a folder called staging?
        -- or all direct children of source tables?

-- TO DO: consider also adding tests/documentation that are in the incorrect subdirectory?
-- TO DO: how to handle staging models that depend on multiple sources?
-- TO DO: how to handle base models?
